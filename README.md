COMP 3350 Assembly Language Programming Project 9

main.asm contains assembly language code to fulfill the requirements in the attached pdf.

Exercise 1 prompts the user for a 32-bit hex number N where N is smaller than 256, then prompts the user to enter N 32-bit hex numbers.
The output will then print the list of numbers entered by the user in order from least to greatest.

Exercise 2 prompts the user for two strings. The program will search the second string to see if it contains the first string. If it does, the output will print the position of the first letter of string 1 in string 2. The first character is considered position 1. ex. User enters "Hi" and "Oh Hi Mark". String 1 begins at position 4 in String 2 so the output is "4".

To execute: clone this repo, open Visual Studio, select "Open project/solution", and navigate to this projects "project.sln" file. Then build and run the debugger.
